Mark Dubowitz ILLUSTRATION: KEN FALLIN
Iran’s proxy strategy never fooled anyone. It’s no secret that the militias ripping up the Middle East, country after country, are loyal to Tehran—but when the shooting starts, the West rushes to pretend otherwise. “Right after Oct. 7,” says Mark Dubowitz, CEO of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, “the Biden administration began disconnecting the dots.”

While it distanced Iran from the attack, “the White House echoed the line that ‘Hamas is ISIS,’” Mr. Dubowitz says. “The more natural thing to say is ‘Hamas is Iran.’ But if the focus is on Iran, then the question becomes: What’s your Iran policy? What are you going to do about the head of the octopus?”

These questions became unavoidable when Iran attacked Israel directly last weekend, but Mr. Dubowitz, 55, has been asking them since 2003. While others focused on Iraq, he worked on Iran sanctions. He was the leading U.S. opponent of the Obama administration’s Iran nuclear deal and worked with the Trump administration on its “maximum pressure” strategy—which, to his disappointment, rarely went beyond sanctions.

In 2019 Iran announced sanctions against Mr. Dubowitz and his think tank, known as FDD, and accused them of “economic terrorism.” He has been living with security protection ever since. “In Washington, I’m called an ‘Iran hawk,’ ” he says, “and it’s so politicized that they think I must be a Republican, too. All I’ve done is try to make the case that the Islamic Republic is a threat to the region, its own people and the U.S., and that it needs to be dealt with, not wished away.” Nobody makes that case better than FDD.

Iran’s shadow-war strategy against Israel is effective. Since Oct. 7, the regime has used its proxies to shock Israel into war, divide its forces, prolong the fighting and bleed it politically, economically and militarily—all without firing a shot from Iranian territory and risking a response in kind. Until April 13, when Iran escalated in reply to an Israeli strike in Syria.

Israeli intelligence didn’t expect such a large response, Mr. Dubowitz says, but “clearly the dynamic was changing.” Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei “had seen that Israel was isolated after three months of Biden beating up on Bibi”—Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu—“and we had 60 members of Congress calling for aid to be cut off. Israel was taking a beating, and I think Khamenei decided this was his opportunity to establish a new normal.”

The ayatollah “thought he would reinforce Israel’s isolation, but he has done the opposite. At least temporarily—very temporarily—Israel got out of the penalty box and Iran has gone in.” On the other hand, “Khamenei has shown only the tip of the iceberg of Iran’s capabilities, and already he has persuaded the U.S. to de-escalate and restrain Israel’s response.”

The escalation is new, but it follows a familiar pattern. “They’re doing what they do on the nuclear program. You keep breaking through red lines, and things that would’ve been intolerable 10 years ago are tolerable today.” The West once thought Iranian enrichment of uranium was intolerable. “Now, they’re enriching uranium to 60%, which is a stone’s throw away from weapons-grade.” Similarly, rockets from Hezbollah and Hamas were once intolerable. “Now, the goal is to normalize that Israel will have to face it directly from Iran.”

That’s why Israel had to attack Iran—a strike that had “an almost poetic symmetry,” as Mr. Dubowitz puts it. “ ‘Our air defenses worked, your expensive S-300 didn’t. You targeted our air force base, we hit your air force base,’ using much less to do much more damage,” and near a nuclear facility. Adding insult to injury, the strike came on Mr. Khamenei’s 85th birthday.

The scope of Israel’s reprisal was limited by political considerations. Israel sought to demonstrate its capabilities and change Iran’s risk calculus “without jeopardizing the U.S. support and regional coalition building.” In this regard as well, Mr. Dubowitz reckons the attack a modest success: “It shifts the onus back on Biden to deliver tough sanctions and diplomatic progress,” he says, “and reaffirms to the Saudis that Israel is the only country with the will and capabilities to take on Iran.”

Hamas’s attack was shocking in its savagery, but “Iran is the most important theater, and its nuclear-weapons program remains the overriding priority” in Mr. Dubowitz’s assessment. If Israel were forced to choose, “between Hamas’s four to six remaining battalions and Iran’s two dozen scientists working on nuclear weaponization, my strong recommendation would be to take out the scientists.”

“Imagine what Oct. 7 would’ve looked like under an Iranian nuclear umbrella,” he says. “A threat of nuclear escalation would lead Biden—or any U.S. president—to put immense pressure on Israel not to respond to any conventional attack.”

He invokes Ukraine: “One Iranian idea is to turn Tel Aviv into Kyiv—create a grinding war of attrition, cause as much damage as possible, drive out the most skilled and flexible Israelis, and leave behind an outmanned and outgunned rump that steadily loses support from the West, which, in the face of nuclear intimidation, limits Israel in how it can fight back.” How’s that for a nightmare scenario?

He worries part of the purpose of the war in Gaza is to distract. “What I found in Israel before Iran’s attack,” he says, “was that the nuclear issue wasn’t even on the back burner.” Busy with the war, “the Israelis hadn’t convened an interagency meeting on Iran’s nuclear program in six months.”

Mr. Dubowitz says Iran has enough enriched material “to break out to one bomb’s worth of weapons-grade uranium in seven days, six bombs’ worth in a month.” And we’ve now seen a demonstration of Iran’s ballistic-missile capabilities: “ ‘These ones have conventional warheads,’ the Iranians were saying. ‘The next one may have unconventional warheads.’ ”

While the Biden administration “has its own acronym for ‘confidence-building measures’—CBMs,” the Iranians have an advanced program to develop ICBMs, intercontinental ballistic missiles. They “aren’t to threaten Israel or the Gulf or Europe, because Iran can threaten them already with ballistic missiles,” he says. “They’ve got only one address: the U.S.A.”

The final task is attaching a nuclear warhead to the missile. Here, Mr. Dubowitz has a bomb of his own to drop: “I have been led to believe that Iran’s weaponization activities have begun. After a long pause during which Iran’s nuclear enrichment and missile program advanced, Iran is now taking preliminary steps that will help build a warhead. That is headline news,” he adds, “because it contradicts the longtime U.S. intelligence consensus, and it suggests the Iranians are even closer to a deliverable nuclear weapon than we had thought.”

Mr. Dubowitz says he has pressed U.S. officials. “I don’t get a straight answer in Washington, but I got a straight answer in Israel: ‘We have evidence, we have intelligence. They have begun preliminary work on the weapon.’ ”

Once the decision is made to build a warhead, Mr. Dubowitz says, the timeline for deployment has been 18 to 24 months. (A primitive device would take only six months.) “But those preliminary steps are important. The idea is to do advance work, with computer modeling and multipoint explosive detonation systems, that can be explained away with nonnuclear purposes. This advances the date for Iran, and limits the time the West would have to stop it.”

Iran has taken defensive steps, beginning to build a new nuclear facility in Natanz. “This one is underneath a mountain, and it is projected to go over 100 meters deep, buried in concrete, heavily fortified,” Mr. Dubowitz says. The concern is that “the Israelis won’t be able to bomb it, and even we, with our massive ordnance penetrators, won’t be able to destroy it.”

This calls for stopping it before it can be built, but it also raises larger questions: “Ultimately, the entire Israeli approach to Iran’s nuclear-weapons program has been to mow the grass. Just delay it and delay it and delay it.” That was effective as far as it went—for years we’ve heard Iran was close to developing nuclear weapons, and it never quite got there. But Iran grew stronger all the while.

“The conceptzia that was destroyed on Oct. 7—it’s also on the nuclear side,” Mr. Dubowitz says. “But we’re not prepared to do deterrence by punishment, rather than deterrence by denial or by deference—the Biden approach. Not the kind of severe punishment that would completely change Iran’s risk-reward calculus.”

How severe? “Deterrence by punishment isn’t only taking out a bunch of scientists. Khamenei needs to understand that his decision to build nuclear weapons will cost him his regime.”

The U.S. could try a more robust version of maximum pressure, “which includes providing maximum support to the Iranian people,” he says. “There are millions of Iranians who despise the regime. But when they took to the streets in 2009, yelling, ‘Obama, are you with us or with the dictator?’ Obama chose the dictator.” (After our interview, Mr. Dubowitz meets the exiled dissident Masih Alinejad, who was the target of an Iranian assassination plot on U.S. soil.)

“The Trump administration said the right things and provided some technical support, but very limited,” he continues. “Then Biden misses this huge opportunity with the Women, Life, Freedom protest movement” sparked by the 2022 murder of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini by Iran’s morality police. Mr. Dubowitz’s eyes close as he recalls how America stood by while the regime put down the protests: “Before the supreme leader trained, financed and armed Hamas to go rape and torture Israeli women, his thugs had been raping and torturing Iranian women.”

Even Israel has overlooked this Iranian weakness. “I’ve had many frustrating conversations with the heads of Israeli agencies who are in the right place” to aid dissidents, he says. “I always got this blank look: ‘Mark, you want us to be in the business of regime change?’ And I say to them, ‘I want you to be in the business of weakening your enemy. Are you in that business?’ ”

“You may not get lucky. The regime may not collapse,” Mr. Dubowitz says, “but it’s always good to put your enemy on defense instead of having it play offense.”

The Biden administration rejects that. “Its takeaway from the Trump years is that flexing of American muscle leads to Iranian nuclear expansion,” he says. Yet “almost all of Iran’s nuclear escalation since May 2018,” when Mr. Trump quit the Iran deal, “has occurred since President Biden was elected promising de-escalation.”

Since Mr. Biden stopped enforcing sanctions, Iran’s oil sales have increased tenfold. Tehran isn’t appeased. “Biden’s Plan A, a deal, has failed for three years. The bribes didn’t work. A longer deal didn’t work. A shorter deal didn’t work,” Mr. Dubowitz says, “but there is no Plan B from the administration. Only de-escalation.”

That leaves Israel to sort out the threats and take the blame. “Fundamentally, the Biden administration doesn’t believe in the use of power against Iran,” Mr. Dubowitz says. “That is why they loathe the Israeli approach, because Israelis, they don’t buy into this sort of CBMs, off-ramps, incentives, deference approach to Iran.”

For years, Israelis have argued that this Iranian regime will never be cajoled into abandoning its pursuit of Israel’s destruction. For that goal, Israelis said, Iran is willing to set the region ablaze and fight to the last Arab. “In a way,” Mr. Dubowitz says, “Khamenei did all of us a favor” with last weekend’s attack. “He has reconnected the dots. It turns out that it’s been the Islamic Republic all along. It’s a war between Israel and Iran.” Will Mr. Biden be able to cover up what has now been exposed?",-0.9996

Aid to Ukraine and Israel got more attention, but the same package of national-security bills contained an important provision expanding sanctions against Iran. Iran’s missile and drone assault on Israel this month solidified support for the measures, which will exact a devastating economic toll on the regime and help thwart the Biden administration’s sanctions-relief effort.

Four of the aid package’s most significant Iran-related provisions are the Mahsa Amini Human Rights and Security Accountability Act, known by the acronym Mahsa; the Stop Harboring Iranian Petroleum, Act, or SHIP; the Holding Iranian Leaders Accountable Act, and the Iran-China Energy Sanctions Act. Two of these bills target high-level officials in the Islamic Republic. The other two support the U.S. position on Iran’s largest source of foreign income: its petroleum industry. Rep. Mike Lawler (R., N.Y.), sponsor of the SHIP Act, said: “We will finally begin to cut off Iran’s funding for terror at its source—its illicit oil trade.”

The Islamic Republic has been war-mongering for decades, and its threats and actions have ramped up amid America’s accommodating policy. Iran’s military spending, oil exports, nuclear progress and domestic repression all correlate with U.S. policy. Since 2020 the U.S. and its European allies have let the sunset clauses in the Iran nuclear deal and United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231 take effect. The West has failed to deter Tehran from advancing its nuclear program and allowed sanctions to expire—including the embargo against ballistic-missile trade.

Iran’s bad behavior has become more flagrant. President Biden has eased the enforcement of some sanctions, such as those on Iran’s oil trade, and waived others, such as those on the revenue from Iran’s electricity shipments to Iraq. This has enriched the Islamic Republic. The Biden administration’s ransom payments for American detainees likewise encouraged Iran’s penchant for hostage-taking.

Fortunately Congress has decided to reclaim its role in keeping the U.S. safe. By passing these measures, lawmakers acknowledged Tehran’s alignment with Beijing and Moscow. Congressional resolve against this axis is a stark contrast with presidential inaction.

The recent legislative volley moves Iran policy beyond nuclear and security matters into human-rights and democracy promotion. The Mahsa Act will pressure, and in some cases mandate, the executive branch to impose sanctions on key Islamic Republic entities and officials, including the supreme leader and president, for their human-rights abuses. Its passage shows that Iranian-American advocacy against the regime is solidifying despite Tehran’s efforts to sow division within the community. Grassroots advocacy helped build bipartisan support for the act and sends a message to Tehran. The Iranian diaspora has shown the U.S. government that there is a strong link between the regime’s political abuses at home and its aggression abroad—and that one can’t be solved without the other.

The legislative package is a defeat for the Islamic Republic’s supporters in Washington and around the world. Many in the diaspora have falsely promoted themselves as representatives of Iranian-Americans or the voice of Iranians in Iran. The pro-Tehran lobby was ascendant during the Obama administration, but its influence is waning. This is a promising trend for those who understand that a peaceful Middle East is possible only if there is a free Iran.

Most Iranian-Americans don’t see the interests of the two countries they love at odds. President Reagan said America’s greatest ally in the Cold War were the Soviet subjects. This view is also true of the conflict between the U.S. and the Islamic Republic. We want a free Iran because we share American interests and honor American values.

This victory will encourage Iranian-Americans to keep making the case for their oppressed brothers and sisters. As the U.S. moves toward reapplying pressure on the Islamic Republic, it must also support the Iranian people.",0.9943

Ebrahim Raisi, who died on Sunday, rose to power as Iran’s eighth president, overseeing the country’s worsening relationship with the West and a harsh crackdown on civil rights at home during the largest protest movement in decades. He was 63.

Raisi was traveling in a helicopter in northwestern Iran when it had to make a hard landing, according to state media. Raisi’s death was announced early Monday on state-run Press TV, which reported that he and Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian were on the helicopter and that several other passengers were also killed.

Raisi, a conservative cleric and decadeslong confidant of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, came to power in the 2021 elections. His victory came after moderate and liberal forces were sidelined and marked the consolidation of anti-Western hard-liners in the Islamic Republic.

Raisi took office as a political novice. Iran’s previous presidents had longstanding political ambitions and pursued their own agenda while in office. By contrast, Raisi was largely seen as a proxy for Khamenei.

“Raisi was more of an apparatchik than a visionary leader,” said Mehrzad Boroujerdi, author of an encyclopedia on Iranian politics, and the vice provost and dean of College of Arts, Sciences, and Education at Missouri University of Science and Technology.

“Among his notable accomplishments was the rapprochement with Saudi Arabia,” Boroujerdi said. “However, his administration’s brutal suppression of the ‘Women, Life, Freedom’ movement in 2022, strict enforcement of hijab laws, support for Russia in the war against Ukraine, and conflicts with Israel cast a long shadow over his presidency.”

Raisi didn’t serve in the military during Iran’s eight-year long war with Iraq in the 1980s, another contrast to some of his predecessors. Instead, he had a long career in the judicial system, including as a prosecutor, during which time he earned a reputation as a hard-liner with little patience for political dissent. Before becoming president, he was known to Iranians for his role in a 1988 commission that condemned thousands of political prisoners to death.

For many Iranians, Raisi’s legacy will be tainted by that part of his past, said Abbas Milani, the director of the Hamid and Christina Moghadam Program in Iranian Studies at Stanford University. “During his presidency the economy fell to new lows and the killing machine continued unabated.”

Raisi was born into a clerical family near the city of Mashhad, considered one of the holiest cities in the world by Shia Muslims because of a shrine there. He joined an Islamic seminary at the age of 15. In the early 1980s, he married Jamileh Alamolhoda, the daughter of a powerful cleric that heads Friday prayer, the main weekly religious service, in Mashhad. She later earned a doctorate in philosophy and now teaches at Shahid Beheshti University in Tehran.

As a young man, Raisi studied in the early 1990s under Khamenei and never strayed far from the leader’s positions. In return, Khamenei rewarded his protégé with a series of promotions. In 2016, he bestowed considerable power upon Raisi by appointing him steward of the Astan Quds Razavi charity, worth billions of dollars and central to the supreme leader’s business interests. When Raisi lost his first attempt at the presidency in 2017, Khamenei instead appointed him head of the powerful judiciary.

Raisi’s close relationship with Khamenei, more than 20 years his senior, led some to believe that he was being groomed to succeed Khamenei as supreme leader.

As president, Raisi helped steer Iran away from diplomacy with the West. While his predecessor signed an international nuclear deal with world powers, he took a more confrontational stance with foreign countries, including Israel. His government also strengthened ties with China and Russia, as part of Iran’s pivot to the east.

He had close relations with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which for more than a decade has expanded Iran’s military footprint abroad, including by propping up militias near the border with Israel, and achieved unprecedented financial and political power at home.

Raisi’s government oversaw an intensified crackdown on Iranians, including during the nationwide 2022 protests, triggered by the death in police custody of Mahsa Amini, who was arrested for allegedly violating the country’s Islamic dress code.

Raisi also presided over mass imprisonments of journalists, political activists and dual citizens, including Americans. Under Raisi, Iran also stepped up detentions of foreign nationals, including several Europeans who were held for years without a fair and free trial, according to Western governments. Previous governments had mostly imprisoned dual citizens with Iranian passports.

For ordinary Iranians, however, the most lasting legacy of Raisi’s tenure will perhaps be the deepening economic hardship, amplified by Iran’s growing isolation and Western sanctions, which sank millions of families into deep poverty, destitution and unemployment.

Many Iranians, particularly young people in the cities or members of the country’s ethnic minorities, will also remember his government for its crackdown on political dissent and its choking of freedom of expression and social liberties. He further undermined trust in authorities with his government playing down the Covid-19 outbreak in the beginning of the pandemic, which hit Iran hard earlier than most countries.

Raisi’s 2021 victory was largely the result of a historically low turnout of 48.8%—a sign of divisions within Iranian society and a reflection of widespread apathy among Iranians and discontent with the lack of real choice in the vote.

Under Raisi, that apathy has grown. The parliamentary vote earlier this year saw another record low turnout.

Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi was killed in a helicopter crash on Sunday, depriving Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei of a longtime ally as Tehran angles for regional dominance through armed militias that are fighting the U.S. and Israel.

Raisi’s death was announced early Monday, after state television reported that a helicopter carrying him and Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian had made a “difficult landing” in northwestern Iran. The military said the cause of the crash was under investigation. Iranian state news media said it resulted from a “technical failure.”

Khamenei announced five days of national mourning and appointed Mohammad Mokhber, first vice president, as the new interim head of the executive branch.

Ali Bagheri-Kani, who has close family ties with Khamenei and previously led Iran’s delegation in nuclear talks with the West, was appointed acting foreign minister.

Under Iran’s constitution, new presidential elections are required to take place within 50 days, and an Iranian official said Monday that the new president would get a full four-year term, rather than serving out the remainder of Raisi’s mandate, which was due to end in 2025. Authorities on Monday said elections would be held on June 28.

The deaths of Raisi, 63, and Amir-Abdollahian, 60, are unlikely to result in any significant change in the country’s foreign policy, including Tehran’s support for Palestinian Islamic militant group Hamas, which is fighting Israeli forces in Gaza, or in its development of its nuclear program.

But a leadership transition amid the current turmoil in the Mideast is an additional challenge for Iran to navigate.

Last week, senior U.S. and Iranian officials held talks in Oman about regional tensions and Iran’s nuclear program, according to people familiar with the meetings. It came after Iran directly attacked Israel for the first time, launching some 300 missiles and drones at the country. Most were intercepted by a U.S. and Israeli coalition in the region.

The helicopter crash did have some immediate impact on Iran’s diplomatic activity. Bagheri-Kani, who held indirect talks with U.S. officials last week mediated by Omani officials, canceled a meeting set to take place in Geneva on Wednesday with Enrique Mora, the European Union official who had chaired nuclear talks, according to a person familiar with the plans.

Iran’s neighbors and allies sent condolences to Tehran, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Lebanon, Iraq and Pakistan declared periods of mourning.



Iranians gathered Monday in Tehran following news of the death of President Ebrahim Raisi.
MARYAM RAHMANIAN FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
Pro-Iranian militias were quick to weigh in on the deaths, with Iran’s most powerful regional proxy, Hezbollah, praising Raisi in religious terms, calling him “a big brother, a strong supporter and a staunch defender of our issues and the nation’s issues.”

Hamas, which has received money and weapons from Iran, praised Raisi and the other officials for their support, which included Iranian praise of the terrorist group’s attack on Israel in October, which Israel said claimed nearly 1,200 lives.

“We express our shared feelings of sadness and pain with the brotherly Iranian people, and our complete solidarity with the Islamic Republic of Iran, in this painful and gravely afflicted incident, which claimed the lives of a group of the best Iranian leaders,” the group said.

Israel didn’t comment on the deaths. Iran had blamed Israel for the 2019 killing of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, widely regarded as the father of Iran’s nuclear-weapons program. Israel neither confirmed nor denied the allegation.

The U.S., the EU, NATO and France’s Foreign Ministry all sent condolences to the victims of the crash and their families. During a nuclear conference, Rafael Grossi, director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, held a moment of silence for what he called the “tragic news.”

“The United States expresses its official condolences for the death of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, Foreign Minister Amir-Abdollahian, and other members of their delegation,” State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said in a statement. “As Iran selects a new president, we reaffirm our support for the Iranian people and their struggle for human rights and fundamental freedoms.”

Other Western officials took a different stance.

“President Raisi’s regime has murdered thousands at home, and targeted people here in Britain and across Europe,” said Britain’s Security Minister Tom Tugendhat. “I will not mourn him.”

Some Iranians expressed grief at the death of the president. 

At Valiasr Square in Tehran, several thousand Islamists and government supporters voiced determination to remain loyal to the system and said they weren’t concerned about the country’s fate with Khamenei still at the helm. Some were in tears.

“Raisi was the people’s humble servant,” said a 57-year-old teacher in Tehran. “He was a president whose car’s windows were not tinted. He frequently traveled to remote areas of the country and listened to people’s complaints and grievances.”

Others appeared jubilant, honking horns in cars with upbeat music in reaction to the news. Some of them exchanged V for victory signs with their hands, smiles on their faces. Other people appeared indifferent to the news as they went about their daily routines.

The grief that was expressed, however, paled in comparison to the response that followed a U.S. airstrike in January 2021 that killed Qassem Soleimani, the architect of Iran’s shadow wars and military expansion in the Middle East. At that time, hundreds of thousands of Iranians turned out across the country to mark his funeral. So large were the crowds that in his hometown of Kerman, more than 50 people were killed in a stampede.

In all, nine men were killed in Sunday’s helicopter crash deep in northwestern Iran, near its border with Azerbaijan. Raisi had traveled to the shared border on Sunday to inaugurate a new dam with Azerbaijan’s leader, Ilham Aliyev, and was en route to Tabriz, the largest city in northwestern Iran, at the time of the crash.

Because of the remote location of the crash site, and heavy fog that enveloped the mountainous area, search-and-rescue teams had to work through the night with drones and dogs to locate the helicopter.

The bodies of the deceased are being transferred to a cemetery in Tabriz, the head of the Iranian Red Crescent told state TV. Raisi will be given a ceremony in Tabriz before his body is transported back to Mashhad, Raisi’s hometown and Iran’s second-largest city.

A conservative cleric and for decades a confidant of Khamenei, Raisi became Iran’s eighth president in August 2021, leading a significantly harder-line government than his predecessor, Hassan Rouhani. There had been speculation that he could be a contender to become the country’s supreme leader when Khamenei, who is 85, dies.

Iran’s relations with the West soured under Raisi, who was elected with the lowest turnout in years after a raft of other contenders were excluded. His election marked the consolidation of anti-Western hard-liners in the Islamic Republic.

Under Raisi, ties with China and Russia grew much closer through Tehran’s “Look East” strategy, including the supply of weapons to Russia for its war in Ukraine. Raisi also helped steer Iran toward a more confrontational stance with Israel.

At Home, Raisi oversaw the country’s worsening relationship with the West, as well as a harsh crackdown on civil rights at home amid the fiercest protests in decades after the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody in September 2022.

Decades earlier, Raisi was known for his role in a 1988 commission that condemned thousands of political prisoners to death. Later, as judiciary chief, he presided over the mass imprisonment of journalists, political activists and dual citizens, including Iranian Americans.

He had enjoyed a close relationship with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which for more than a decade has expanded Iran’s military footprint abroad, including by propping up militias near Israel’s borders.

On the nuclear front, the Biden administration had come close to reaching a deal to revive the 2015 nuclear agreement before Raisi’s election, but the new government put talks on hold for months and then returned to the negotiating table with new demands.

Talks collapsed in 2022, ending the possibility of broad Western sanctions relief for Iran in exchange for tight but temporary restrictions on Iran’s nuclear work.

While Khamenei has the final word on decisions over nuclear policy, Iran’s nuclear work advanced significantly after Raisi took office. Iran has now produced enough fissile material for around three nuclear weapons, experts said. Iran denies working on nuclear weapons, and U.S. officials said there is no current evidence that they are trying to build a weapon.

Few analysts expect dramatic changes to Iran’s policies on the global stage, including the nuclear issue and the war in Gaza.

Yoel Guzansky, an expert on Iran and the Arab Gulf countries at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, said Raisi’s death will likely have little direct impact on Iranian policy toward Israel but could embolden opposition to the regime.

“It has the potential of weakening Iran more and prompting inside and outside actors to help Iran to fail,” he said.

Among the Iranian diaspora, there was largely jubilation at the death of Raisi, who had long been the nemesis of some opposition groups.

Many of the victims of the 1988 killings were linked to Mujahedin-e Khalq, an exiled Iranian opposition group. The group’s leader, Maryam Rajavi, said in a statement that Raisi’s death was a “monumental and irreparable blow” to the regime.

“The curse of mothers and those seeking justice for the executed, along with the damnation of the Iranian people and history, mark the legacy of Ebrahim Raisi,” she said.",-0.9995

Luke Vargas: Iran's president dies in a helicopter crash. We'll look at what his death means at a crucial time for the Middle East. Plus, China sanctions US defense contractors over arms sales to Taiwan, as the island inaugurates its new president. And issues at Boeing cloud the forecast for Europe's biggest airline.

Ben Katz: Ryanair is one of the biggest customers for Boeing 737 Max. And they've said that there's actually a lot of uncertainty in the market, which is preventing them from issuing guidance for the next 12 months. And a lot of that uncertainty does come down to Boeing.

Luke Vargas: It's Monday, May 20th. I'm Luke Vargas for the Wall Street Journal and here is the AM edition of What's News, the top headlines and business stories moving your world today. Iranian state television has confirmed this morning that President Ebrahim Raisi died in a helicopter crash yesterday, following reports that the chopper carrying him and Iran's foreign minister had made a difficult landing in the country's mountainous northwest. And here now with a look at what happened exactly and what Raisi's death means for Iran and for the rest of the world, is Journal foreign correspondent, Sune Rasmussen. Sune, give us the very latest. Overnight, the word had been that search and rescue efforts were ongoing, but now obviously Raisi has been confirmed dead.

Sune Rasmussen: Yeah, so the Iranian authorities last night sent out drones and dogs and search and rescue teams to try and find the helicopter that had disappeared in the fog. The helicopter was traveling from Azerbaijan and then the helicopter crashed, it seemed, on its way back. Early this morning, they found the wreckage and confirmed that eight people had been killed, including President Raisi and his foreign minister, Hussein Amir-Abdollahian.

Luke Vargas: Remind us who Ebrahim Raisi was. His predecessors, Hassan Rouhani, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, very well known in the West by comparison. Who was Raisi within the Iranian political system? What is the importance of his death to that system?

Sune Rasmussen: Yeah, interestingly, Raisi was not hugely famous before he became president. He was mostly known for his role in the late '80s on what was called the Death Commission, which was a commission of four people who collectively sentenced thousands of political dissidents to death. So he was highly controversial for his role on that. But then he's also been a close confidant of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei for his entire career. Raisi was handpicked to run one of the country's most important charities out in eastern Iran, which is very close to the supreme leader's business interests. And when Raisi ran for president for the first time in 2017, he lost, but then Khamenei picked him to be head of the country's powerful judiciary to sort of keep him close to power. Then he won the election in 2021. And since he became president, he's largely been seen as a proxy for Khamenei, so that means like a hardline conservative cleric who's quite hostile to the West, skeptical of diplomacy with the West. But he's also overseen a very harsh crackdown on human rights, and these nationwide protests that we all remember from 2022, after the death of Mahsa Amini, the young woman who was arrested for allegedly violating the country's Islamic dress code. So that's his legacy, a crackdown on human rights and then a collapse of diplomacy with the West, in addition, of course, to this increased conflict in the region.

Luke Vargas: All right. An interesting character here, one whose role within the Iranian system may be a little bit difficult to read from the outside. So given that, what's next, where does this leave Iran, especially geopolitically at this moment?

Sune Rasmussen: So the Iranian president is not the most important political figure in Iran. All matters of national security, the key political issues, be it the nuclear program or Iran's military strategy in the Middle East, those are determined by primarily the supreme leader, but also the Revolutionary Guard. That said, Raisi's death comes at a really tricky time for Iran, which is embroiled in growing conflicts around the Middle East, of course with Israel, but also in other countries. It faces deep economic hardship at home. And then there's this looming question over who will succeed Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei when he eventually dies. Khamenei is 85, he has a history of illness. And Raisi was one of the few people who was mentioned as a possible successor to Khamenei. The immediate steps now for the Iranian leadership is to convey a message to Iranians that the political course will not change. But then there's also practical steps. According to the Iranian constitution, in case of the death of a president, the country is obliged to hold elections within 50 days. And until then, the vice president will be caretaker of the country. And the current vice president ran many of Raisi's affairs, so he's an experienced guy who will take the helm. And he will form a three-man committee, with the head of judiciary and the head of parliament, to organize these elections within 50 days.

Luke Vargas: Lots to watch for in the coming days and weeks. That was Wall Street Journal foreign correspondent, Sune Rasmussen. Sune, thank you so much for the update.

Sune Rasmussen: You're welcome, Luke.

Luke Vargas: Coming up, Taiwan inaugurates its new president, as questions swirl over how the island balances relations with Beijing. We've got that story and much more after the break. Taiwan's new president, Lai Ching-te, has been inaugurated and kicked off his first day in office by taking a swing at China in a carefully calibrated speech. With Beijing and Washington both listening carefully, Journal reporter, Austin Ramzy, told me that Lai, who had been perceived by China to be a strong advocate for Taiwan's independence, did push back against Beijing's territorial claim over the island, but largely pulled his punches.

Austin Ramzy: Well, he's in a bit of a difficult position. His party lost its majority in the legislature, so it's a bit of a stalemate. He did criticize Beijing and blamed China for tensions in the Taiwan Straits and suggested that any sort of conflict would arise from Beijing's actions. But at the same time, he sort of had more concrete positions in terms of reaching out to Beijing than he was able to offer on any sort of domestic issues.

Luke Vargas: Yeah, he said he would allow Chinese students to come to Taiwan and would lift restrictions on tourism. And yet, Austin, Beijing's response to this has been firm, with the government spokesman saying Taiwan's independence and peace in the Taiwan Strait were incompatible. And we have also seen Beijing hit back at Boeing and two other defense companies today, that have sold arms to Taiwan. What should we make of that?

Austin Ramzy: Well, Beijing was expected to have some sort of reaction to Lai's inauguration. And they've done this before, they have issued sanctions against defense companies. In terms of how it will actually affect those companies, they're restricted in their ability to sell arms to China anyway. This is probably something that those companies were anticipating in some ways, that Beijing might issue those sort of sanctions.

Luke Vargas: All right. So this reaction from Beijing, maybe not a huge surprise, and yet this is coming at a time of heightened tension around Taiwan.

Austin Ramzy: That's right. This is always a potential flashpoint and China has been carrying out almost daily military drills, aircraft flights in the Taiwan Strait. The new Taiwan government seems to be sending a signal that they don't want to do anything to exacerbate tensions, but it's also in Beijing's hands, so we have to wait and see what happens.

Luke Vargas: That was the Journal's Austin Ramzy in Taipei. Meanwhile, Beijing has hinted that it could open an investigation into European chemical imports as retaliation against EU probes into Chinese firms. The Chinese commerce ministry said it will probe imports of a plastic, widely used in auto parts and electronics, brought in from the US, EU, Japan, and Taiwan. It comes amid escalating trade tensions between China and the EU and the US, with the Biden administration just last week sharply increasing tariffs on Chinese goods, including electric vehicles, steel and aluminum products and solar cells. And we are exclusively reporting that the US has privately warned telecom companies that undersea internet cables in the Pacific could be vulnerable to tampering by Chinese repair ships. State Department officials have said a state-controlled Chinese company that helps repair international cables, S.B. Submarine Systems, or SBSS, appeared to be hiding the location of its vessels from radio and satellite tracking in a move that defied easy explanation. However, US and Congressional officials wouldn't say whether their worries stemmed from classified intelligence about maritime espionage or only potential threats to infrastructure. Google and Meta, who partially own many undersea fiber optic cables and are investing in more, were among the firms that were informed about the US concerns, though both declined to comment on the warnings. The Biden administration declined to comment on SBSS and SBSS didn't respond to requests for comment. Well, switching gears, Red Lobster has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in Florida, with plans to sell its business to a group controlled by its existing term lenders. As we reported last week, the largest seafood chain in the US plans to use bankruptcy proceedings to reduce debt and streamline the number of restaurants that it operates. Higher financing costs and slower consumer spending have hurt a number of chain restaurants in recent years, with Red Lobster already closing dozens of its 650 restaurants across 20 states. And one of Boeing's key customers, Ryanair, says that a lack of certainty over new plane deliveries could lead to higher ticket prices this summer. Europe's biggest airline did announce a major share buyback, but as aviation reporter, Ben Katz, explains, Ryanair is still short 23 Boeing planes, a factor that's clouding the outlook for future passenger growth.

Ben Katz: They actually, interestingly, didn't give a forward-looking guidance for next year. And they cited, as part of that, the issue surrounding Boeing and Boeing's delivery plans for the next year. Especially over the next few months, which was really the critical summer period, where Ryanair and most other airlines, at least in Europe, make the most of their money. That being said, Michael O'Leary, the CEO of Ryanair, has actually come out as one of the biggest supporters of Boeing, saying that he thinks they'll get through this crisis that they're in now. He did call for a leadership change at the top of the commercial business, but he's kind of thrown his weight behind the likes of David Calhoun, who is the CEO of the company at the moment.

Luke Vargas: And that's What's News for Monday morning. Today's show was produced by Daniel Bach and Kate Bullivant. Our supervising producer is Sandra Kilhof. And I'm Luke Vargas for the Wall Street Journal. We will be back tonight with a new show. Until then, thanks for listening.",-0.9854
